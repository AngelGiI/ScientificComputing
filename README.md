**Scientific Computing - Fortran and C++**

This repository contains work completed during my Scientific Computing course, focusing on computational methods for solving scientific and engineering problems. The course utilized both **Fortran** and **C++** to develop efficient and modular code for various numerical applications.

### Overview:
- **Fortran:**  
  Focused on programming fundamentals for scientific computation, including numerical methods, data processing, and modular programming. The course emphasized Fortran's efficiency and relevance for scientific applications, using foundational concepts and best practices.
  
- **C++:**  
  Covered key programming paradigms, including procedural and modular programming, with applications in file handling, numerical methods, and memory management.

The course highlighted practical programming skills and their application in solving real-world problems, combining Fortran's scientific computing legacy with C++'s versatility for more advanced computational tasks.
